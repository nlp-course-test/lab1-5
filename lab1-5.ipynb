    "1. Loading of annotated textual corpora.\n",
    "2. Tokenization and normalization of the text.\n",

    "5. Evaluation of the models on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than recapitulate all of these component tasks for each application, standard packages have been developed to facilitate them.

These fields themselves have specifications that tell whether the data in that field is sequential (like text sequences) or simple (like class labels); whether and how to preprocess, tokenize, or postprocess the data; and many other properties. Dataset objects can be easily split into parts (training and test, for instance), or turned into a sequence of small batches for processing by models.\n",

Since $U$ is of dimenionality $1 \\times D$, the output is a vector of dimensionality $D$. (We refer to $D$ as the hidden dimension.) Then comes another perceptron layer with output of dimensionality $D$. Finally, a single linear layer reduces the dimensionality back to the predicted scalar output $\\tilde{y}$ of dimensionality $1$.
